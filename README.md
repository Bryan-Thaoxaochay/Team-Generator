## What I Learned

### List
1. Exporting and Importing

    I got some practice using module.exports for functions, as well as calling the functions and modules with require().

2. Inquirer Module
    
    In the previous assignment, I wasn't aware of when:. It was very useful in this assignment, to display certain questions based on previous questions.

3. fs Module

    The fs module was very useful to send the answers of my inquirer prompt to the HTML. Using the readFile to access the HTML, using replace() to place the variable into the HTML, and then using writeFile to add it to the HTML.

4. Arrays and Objects

    Useful in storing responses so that I can access them later on when I was attaching them to the HTML.

5. Functions
    
    With help, I figured out that placing the inquirer prompt into a function lets us recall it in an if/else statement so that the user can go through the questions again. This helps the user add multiple members.

6. Classes and Constructors

    Got some practice creating classes, constructors, using extend, and exporting and importing them to each other.

7. Tests
